# DGR
Deterministic grid-based resampling as implemented in the paper "Improving LiDAR 3D Object Detection via Range-based Point Cloud Density Optimization" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05663). The LiDAR point cloud from Velodyne is resampled by sepcifying the new vertical and horizontal angular resolutions. 

Velodyne HDL-64E data is available at https://pdf.directindustry.com/pdf/velodynelidar/hdl-64e-datasheet/182407-676099.html

Deterministic Grid Sampling with Number of Beams = 60, Horizontal resolution = 0.1 degrees:
